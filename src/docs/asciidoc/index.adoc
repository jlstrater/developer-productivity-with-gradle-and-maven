(Gradle & Maven)
|===

== Why is Developer Productivity important?

[%step]
* Long developer cycles -> longer to get to production
* More time waiting -> less times to develop features
* Context switching -> more time to work on each feature

[NOTE.speaker]
Context switching like meetings in the middle of the day
Waiting includes CI, requirements, waiting on feedback from QA, etc.

== How are builds critical to Developer Productivity?

[%step]
* inefficient builds take longer to run
* when build take too long there can be context switching
* non-reproducable builds can cause problems at the least convenient times

[NOTE.speaker]
And many more!

=== Waiting

image::compiling.png[width=50%, height=auto]
One extra minute per build destroys 4% of engineering capacity, on average.

[NOTE.speaker]
source: gradle.com

=== Lost Time on Debugging

image::debugging.png[width=50%, height=auto]

=== Debugging Time
* On average, 20% of all builds fail because of code defects.
* This easily adds up to 5-10% of engineering capacity.
* Netflix has done internal studies that show that this consumes 20% of their engineering capacity.

[NOTE.speaker]
This is fine and is actually the job of the build. But it often takes way too long to find the cause for such a failure.
Easily 5-10% of engineering capacity are spend on this.

== How many builds are you running?

[NOTE.speaker]
Do you even know? Is it only CI data? What about your developer machines?
How long does it take? Is it minutes? Hours? What was it one month ago?

== Gradle Team Demo

[NOTE.speaker]
144,335 for just July 2-9! And that's only a small team of 15-20 devs and one CI server.

== Faster builds

image::subsection.png[background, size=cover]

[NOTE.speaker]
Productivity is important, but what can you do about it?

=== How do we get faster?

[.line-through]
=== How do we get faster?

[NOTE.speaker]
That is the wrong question.

=== What is slow?

[%conceal]
=== Scan

image::scan.png[width=1024, height=auto]

[NOTE.speaker]
The first data point: get the speed of individual builds with free build scans. scans.gradle.com or --scan for gradle.

[%conceal]
=== performance

image::performance-dashboard.png[width=auto, height=auto]

[NOTE.speaker]
1 data point means nothing or even a few. Once all builds are being scanned, we can make inferences.

[%conceal]
=== trends

image::trends-dashboard.png[width=1920, height=auto]

== How do we get faster?

* More efficient use of resources
* Don't rebuild what hasn't changed
* Fail fast
* Fix failures faster

[NOTE.speaker]
parallelization, using the daemon, etc.
build caching
tests especially, but also dependency conflicts, and other parts of the build.

== How do we get faster?

* **More efficient use of resources**
* Don't rebuild what hasn't changed
* Fail fast
* Fix failures faster

=== Resource usage

image::jake-wharton-macbook-performance.png[width=75%, height=auto]

=== Settings & Suggestions

image::settings_and_suggestions.png[width=960, height=auto]

[NOTE.speaker]
Gradle only as of 2019.2

Gradle Performance Guide

[NOTE.speaker]
including more advice like performance tuning the JVM settings.
Is there an equivalent for Maven?

== How do we get faster?

* More efficient use of resources
* **Don't rebuild what hasn't changed**
* Fail fast
* Fix failures faster

=== Incremental Builds

image::up-to-date-example.png[width=650, height=auto]

link:https://blog.gradle.org/introducing-incremental-build-support[https://blog.gradle.org/introducing-incremental-build-support]

[NOTE.speaker]
built-in for Gradle; only in the GE extension for Maven
UP-TO-DATE checking is one example
results in more efficient compilation

[%notitle]
=== Maven vs. Gradle

image::maven-vs-gradle.png[height=auto]

[%conceal]
=== What is caching?

image::what-is-a-build-cache.png[width=auto, height=auto]

=== How does the Build Cache work?

[%step]
- The _cacheKey_ for Tasks/Goals is based on the Inputs: +
  _cacheKey(javaCompile)_ = _hash(sourceFiles, ...)_
- The _cacheEntry_ contains the output: +
  _cacheEntry[cacheKey(javaCompile)]_ = _fileTree(classFiles)_

link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html#sec:task_output_caching[userguide/build_cache.html#sec:task_output_caching]

[NOTE.speaker]
inputs can also include the task type and its classpath, names of output properties, etc.

=== Build Cache for Gradle

[%step]
[source,text]
----
$> gradle --build-cache assemble
:compileJava FROM-CACHE
:processResources
:classes
:jar
:assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

=== Build Cache for Gradle

* By default in Java, Groovy, Scala, C++ und Swift
* Supports tasks such as Compile, Javadoc, Test und Verification

link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html#sec:task_output_caching_cacheable_tasks[userguide/build_cache.html#sec:task_output_caching_cacheable_tasks]

=== Build Cache for Maven

* Part of the Gradle Enterprise Maven Extension
* Initial Release: March 2019
* Supported Plugins: Java Compiler, Surefire/Failsafe, Javadoc, JAXB, Checkstyle, and more!

=== Test failures

[source,groovy]
test {
    failFast = true
}

[source,console]
gradle integTest --fail-fast

[NOTE.speaker]
NOT the same as maven fail fast which is Gradle's default behavior.

=== Dependency Conflicts



=== Use Gradle ;)
